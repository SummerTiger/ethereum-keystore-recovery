# GitHub Repository Setup Complete

## ✅ Configurations Applied

### 1. Code Ownership
**File**: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- **Global Owner**: @SummerTiger
- **Scope**: All files require your review
- **Critical paths** with mandatory review:
  - `.github/` - All workflow and configuration files
  - `pom.xml` - Dependency changes
  - `src/main/java/` - All source code
  - Security-sensitive files (validators)

### 2. Branch Protection Rules (main)
**Status**: ✅ Enabled

**Protection Settings**:
- ✅ **Require pull request before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: 1
  - Dismiss stale reviews: Yes
  - **Require code owner reviews: Yes** (@SummerTiger must approve)

- ✅ **Require status checks to pass**
  - Must be up to date before merging
  - Required checks:
    - Build and Test
    - Security Scan
    - Code Quality

- ✅ **Require conversation resolution**
  - All PR comments must be resolved

- ✅ **Require linear history**
  - No merge commits allowed (cleaner git history)

- ✅ **Block force pushes** to main
- ✅ **Block deletions** of main branch

### 3. Security Features
- ✅ **Dependabot alerts**: Enabled
  - Found: 2 vulnerabilities (1 moderate, 1 low)
  - Action needed: Review at https://github.com/SummerTiger/ethereum-keystore-recovery/security/dependabot

- ⚠️ **Secret scanning**: Needs manual setup
  - Go to: Settings → Code security and analysis
  - Enable "Secret scanning"
  - Enable "Push protection for secret scanning"

### 4. Automated Dependency Updates
**Status**: ✅ Already configured via `.github/dependabot.yml`
- Weekly Maven dependency checks
- Weekly GitHub Actions updates
- Auto-creates PRs with your review required

---

## 🔒 What This Means

### For Direct Pushes to Main
**Result**: Allowed (you're admin) but shows warnings:
```
Bypassed rule violations for refs/heads/main:
- Changes must be made through a pull request
- 3 of 3 required status checks are expected
```

**Best Practice**: Create PRs even for your own changes to trigger CI/CD checks.

### For Pull Requests (Future Collaborators)
**Workflow**:
1. Someone creates a PR to `main`
2. CI/CD runs automatically (Build and Test, Security Scan, Code Quality)
3. All 3 status checks must pass ✅
4. **@SummerTiger is automatically requested as reviewer** (CODEOWNERS)
5. You must approve the PR
6. All conversations must be resolved
7. Then PR can be merged (squash merge for clean history)

### For Dependabot PRs
**Workflow**:
1. Dependabot creates PR for dependency update
2. CI/CD runs automatically
3. **You review** the changes
4. If safe, approve and merge
5. Branch auto-deleted after merge

## 📋 Additional Manual Setup Needed

### 1. Enable Secret Scanning (5 minutes)
Go to: https://github.com/SummerTiger/ethereum-keystore-recovery/settings/security_analysis

Steps:
1. Scroll to "Code security and analysis"
2. Click "Enable" for:
   - ✅ Secret scanning
   - ✅ Push protection for secret scanning
3. Save changes

### 2. Review Dependabot Alerts
Go to: https://github.com/SummerTiger/ethereum-keystore-recovery/security/dependabot

Current alerts: 2 (1 moderate, 1 low)

**Action**:
1. Review each vulnerability
2. Check if update is available
3. If yes, click "Create Dependabot security update"
4. Dependabot will create PR with fix
5. Review and merge if safe

### 3. Optional: Enable CodeQL Analysis
Go to: https://github.com/SummerTiger/ethereum-keystore-recovery/settings/security_analysis

Steps:
1. Scroll to "Code scanning"
2. Click "Set up" for "CodeQL analysis"
3. Choose "Default" configuration
4. Click "Enable CodeQL"

This adds automated security scanning for Java code vulnerabilities.

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Try Direct Push (Should Show Warning)
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Direct push test"
git push origin main
```

**Expected**: Push succeeds but shows "Bypassed rule violations" warning.

### Test 2: Create a PR (Recommended Workflow)
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/test-pr
echo "# Test PR" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Testing PR workflow"
git push origin feature/test-pr

# Create PR via CLI
gh pr create --title "Test PR" --body "Testing the PR workflow"
```

**Expected**:
- CI/CD runs automatically
- @SummerTiger requested as reviewer
- Cannot merge until all checks pass + your approval

### Test 3: Check Protection Rules
```bash
# View current protection
gh api repos/SummerTiger/ethereum-keystore-recovery/branches/main/protection | jq
```
