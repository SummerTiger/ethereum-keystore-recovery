## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
1. **PasswordConfig Markdown Parsing** (Critical)
   - **Issue**: Regex failed to match markdown list items without trailing space
   - **Impact**: Configuration files rejected if missing trailing spaces
   - **Fix**: Updated regex pattern to make trailing space optional
   - **Tests**: 31 unit tests to prevent regression

### Security Fixes
2. **Path Traversal Vulnerability** (High)
   - **Issue**: No validation on keystore file paths
   - **Impact**: Potential unauthorized file access
   - **Fix**: Added `InputValidator.validateKeystorePath()` with traversal detection
   - **Protection**: Blocks `../`, null bytes, symlinks to restricted areas

3. **File Size Limits** (Medium)
   - **Issue**: No limits on keystore file size
   - **Impact**: Potential DoS via large file uploads
   - **Fix**: 10 MB limit with clear error messages

4. **Log Injection** (Medium)
   - **Issue**: Unsanitized user input in logs
   - **Impact**: Potential log file corruption or injection attacks
   - **Fix**: `InputValidator.sanitizeForLog()` removes control characters

### Performance Fixes
5. **IndexOutOfBoundsException with High Thread Counts**
   - **Issue**: Crash when threadCount > base combinations
   - **Impact**: Tool unusable with certain configurations
   - **Fix**: Dynamic chunk size calculation with safety checks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Technical Limitations
1. **Password Memory Handling**
   - Web3j API requires `String` (not `char[]`)
   - Passwords may remain in heap until GC
   - **Mitigation**: Run offline, reboot after recovery, use disk encryption

2. **JVM Version**
   - Requires Java 15+ for text blocks and enhanced features
   - **Workaround**: None - Java 15+ is a hard requirement

3. **Platform-Specific Features**
   - POSIX file permissions only on Unix/Mac
   - Windows doesn't support `chmod 0600`
   - **Impact**: Minimal - Windows has equivalent ACLs

### Functional Limitations
1. **Pattern-Based Recovery Only**
   - Only works if you remember password pattern
   - Not suitable for completely forgotten passwords
   - **Alternative**: Try dictionary attacks or brute force (not included)

2. **Single Keystore Format**
   - Only supports Ethereum UTC JSON keystores
   - Does not support other formats (Bitcoin, etc.)
   - **Future**: Multi-format support planned for v1.0
